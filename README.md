We would like to explore and process the flights data in order to answer following questions:

how many total number of days does the flights table cover?
how many departure cities (not airports) does the flights database cover?
what is the relationship between flights and planes tables?
which airplane manufacturer incurred the most delays in the analysis period?
which are the two most connected cities?
